# Judicio Ver 1.0

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
 
 basically fork this repository and open it in your respective text editors. 
 in order to start the front-end server only: type npm run dev
                                              if error occurs saying 'vite' not found, write the following command:
                                              npm install --save-dev vite

in order to start both front-end and backend: type npm start as well npm run dev (follow sequence for convenience)

And now you should have a working Judicio application in this link: http://localhost:5174/

not to all users of repo: before committing anything to your respective forks, dont forget to use the following commands in right sequence:
1. git fetch  
2. git pull
3. now you can safely commit your changes.

thanks
