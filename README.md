# Judicio Ver 1.0

 
 basically fork this repository and open it in your respective text editors. 
 in order to start the application: type [ npm run dev ] if error occurs saying 'vite' not found, write the following command: npm install --save-dev vite

server is already hosted at https://judicio-server.onrender.com/

And now you should have a working Judicio application in this link(s): http://localhost:5173/ or http://localhost:5174/

not to all users of repo: before committing anything to your respective forks, dont forget to use the following commands in right sequence:
1. git fetch  
2. git pull
3. now you can safely commit your changes.

thanks
